# Contributing

> This plugin is designed as an addon for Karma and pull requests are welcomed

## Testing

Running `npm test` will cause the plugin to load and execute in the context of the local test directory.

Ensure that you have not skipped optional dependencies when running npm install.  You will need karma-coverage to be loaded for the tests to demonstrate that our overwritten reporter worked correctly.
